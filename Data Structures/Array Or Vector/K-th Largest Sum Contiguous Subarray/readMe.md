# Given an array of integers. Write a program to find the K-th largest sum of contiguous subarray within the array of numbers which has negative and positive numbers.

# Constraints
-  1 < size Of Array <= 10^6
-  0 < Array Elements <= 10^6
-  0 < K <= 10^9

# Input
- Array
- Its Size
- Integer 'K'

# Output
- Print the K-th Largest Sum that can be found.

```
Input : arr[] = [10, -10, 20, -40]
        k = 6
Output : -10

Input : arr[] = [20, -5, -1]
        k = 3
Output : 14
